# science-notes
Notes written by me on mathematics applied to science, such as physics, chemistry and biology, using LaTeX. In Italian language.

The notes is still in its infancy, the structure is tentative and the chapters are drafts and may still change over time. I am currently summarizing and writing in a basic way the concepts I want to explain.


An English version is planned, after the Italian one.
